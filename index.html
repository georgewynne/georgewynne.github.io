<h2>Research</h2>
<p>My research interests broadly lie in kernel methods and Gaussian processes applied to functional data, in particular to statistical tests.</p> 

<p>The tools I mostly use are 
<a href = 'https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781402076794' target = '_blank'><span>reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory</span></a>, 

<a href = 'https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/scattered-data-approximation/980EEC9DBC4CAA711D089187818135E3' target = '_blank'><span>scattered data approximation</span></a>
and 

<a href = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09522' target = '_blank'><span>kernel mean embeddings</span></a>.</p>

	<li>
		I've been awarded a top 10% reviewer at UAI 2021
	</li>
	<li>
		I will be giving a talk at IWFOS 2021 about applications of kernel mean embeddings to functional data <a href = 'https://iwfos2020.sci.muni.cz' target = '_blank'><span>LINK</span></a>

		Our new pre-print "Statistical Depth Meets Machine Learning: Kernel Mean Embeddings and Depth in Functional Data Analysis" with Stanislav Nagy just hit arxiv <a href = 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12778' target = '_blank'><span>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12778</span></a>. In it we show that some common notions of statistical depth used in functional data analysis coincide with kernel mean embeddings and then leverage this to address some open problems surrounding statistical depth for functional data.
